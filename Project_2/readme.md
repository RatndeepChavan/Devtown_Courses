# Project Task Management :

_This is simple project of task management as part of my MERN stack course. I used **HTML**, **Bootstrap(for css)** and **Vanilla JS** to build this project. In this project I'm trying to **showcase my javascript knowledge** in this project._

### Project Working :

    - All tasks are shown in card format with initial text and if no card present then respective message shown on screen.
    - User can add new task by clicking on "Add Task" button.
    - User can delete any tasks by clicking delete icon located on respective card header.
    - User can read details by clicking on view task which will popup new screen infront with task details.
    - In Tasks details screen user can edit the task information. (date is not editable)
    - User can also search for specific task by using search option. (Task whose title contains user's searched text will be shown as result)

## Project's technical points :

    - Browser's **local storage** is used for data storage.
    - **In place editing and updating** of task details in update option.
    - larger and smaller screen devices uses **different search elements**.
    - **Responsive design** is managed by Bootstrap and JS.
    - Several **confirmation prompt** to avoid accidental click from user.
